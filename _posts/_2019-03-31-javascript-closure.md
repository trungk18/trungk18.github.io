title: "What is a Closure in JavaScript?"
categories: experience

I still remember the interview with one of a customer 4 years ago when I still worked in Hanoi. I was just graduted from university that time and didn't have much experiene. 

There was some basic questions such as `"1" + 1 will evaluate in what value?`. I knew the answer is `"11"` but have no idea what is [type coercion](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/js-type-coercion-explained-27ba3d9a2839) and why the value is `"11"`.

And then the guys started asking about **Closure**. I answered in a very naive way `It is function which is return in another function...`. The guys on the phone wasn't laughing but I know that I was totally wrong. I only read from this [js_function_closures](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_closures.asp) before.

So today, after more than 4 years working mostly with JavaScript. Built many application from small to large scale that serve ten of thousands users. I hope that I can answer this question in an appropriate way.
