This is my personal portfolio written with **jQuery and AngularJS using RequireJS as AMD**.

I work with small and medium-sized businesses, design teams and agencies, building fast, responsive and usable website front-ends, with strong focus on **HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, responsive design and performance**.

What I *can* help you with:

    * Responsive Design and grid frameworks (**Bootstrap** and **Foundation**).

    * **RequireJS** for file and module loader.
    * **Bower** for dependency management.
