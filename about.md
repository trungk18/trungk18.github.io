I work with small and medium-sized businesses, design teams and agencies, building fast, responsive and usable website front-ends, with strong focus on **HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, responsive design and performance**.

### What I *can* help you with:
- Front-end development: Working with UI/UX designers to convert designs into responsive, performant and standards-compliant websites, using **HTML5, CSS and JavaScript**.
    * Responsive Design and grid frameworks (**Bootstrap** and **Foundation**).
