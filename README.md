#####Front-end Developer - .NET/SharePoint Developer - SharePoint Administrator

This is my personal portfolio based on [Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/) template.

I work with small and medium-sized businesses, design teams and agencies, building fast, responsive and usable website front-ends, with strong focus on **HTML5, SVG, CSS, JavaScript, responsive design and performance**.

If you’re a designer or a design agency looking for someone to implement your designs in a responsive, performant manner, and think you can benefit from my skill set, then I’m happy to hear from you.

What I *can* help you with:
- Front-end development: Working with UI/UX designers to convert designs into responsive, performant and standards-compliant websites, using **HTML5, SVG, CSS and JavaScript**.
- Adding **interactions** and **animations** to existing websites/application interfaces.
- Back-end development with .NET technology such as **ASP.NET MVC5, SharePoint 2013**.
- Working as SharePoint Administrator.

What I *can’t* help you with:
- Designing a user interface for your website or app. I am not a **designer**.
- I don’t create design mockups, wireframes or static design deliverables of that sort.
