### Front-end Developer

Hi! My name is Trung. I’m the only front-end engineer at Zyllem, where I work mostly with Angular to build client side web app. I love thinking about development and user experience.

What I *can* help you with:

- Front-end development: Working with UI/UX designers to convert designs into responsive, performant and standards-compliant websites, using **HTML5, CSS and JavaScript**.
    * Responsive Design and grid frameworks (**Bootstrap** and **Foundation**).
    * CSS pre-processor including **LESS** and **SASS**.
    * JavaScript MVC / MVW frameworks - **Angular, React**.
    * Consumption of RESTful web APIs or web services.
- Adding **interactions** and **animations** to existing websites/application interfaces.

What I *can’t* help you with:

- Designing a user interface for your website or app. I am not a **designer**.
- I don’t create design mockups, wireframes or static design deliverables of that sort.

Find me around the web.
