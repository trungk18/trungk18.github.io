I have this unsettling urge to build things. Sometimes work just flows, sometimes I question my life choices. Here are some of my side projects I built:

<h3 class="project-content">    
    <a class="project-title" href="https://fireslack-realtime.firebaseapp.com/" target="_blank">Slack chat app</a>
    <span class="project-date">2017</span>
</h3>

This is the clone of Slack chat app with real-time support using  AngularJS to test the capability of Firebase Auth and Real time database.


<h3 class="project-content">    
    <a class="project-title" href="https://trungk18.github.io/jquery-loading/" target="_blank">jquery-loading</a>
    <span class="project-date">2016</span>
</h3>

A lightweight library to show a "loading" indicator while element is retrieving from server.

<h3 class="project-content">    
    <a class="project-title" href="https://www.nugit.co/" target="_blank">Nugit Branding Website</a>
    <span class="project-date">2018 Oct</span>
</h3>

My team at [Chosen Lab](https://www.thechosenlab.com/) renovated this website using [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), a blazing fast modern site generator for React. This is the first time we built a headless CMS. We chose [DatoCMS](https://www.datocms.com/) for that purpose.
