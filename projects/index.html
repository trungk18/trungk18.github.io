I have this unsettling urge to build things. Sometimes work just flows,
sometimes I question my life choices. Here are some of my side projects I built:

<h3 class="project-content">
  <a
    class="project-title"
    href="https://fireslack-realtime.firebaseapp.com/"
    target="_blank"
    >Slack chat app</a
  >
  <span class="project-date">2017</span>
</h3>

This is the clone of Slack chat app with real-time support using AngularJS to
test the capability of Firebase Auth and Real time database.

<h3 class="project-content">
  <a
    class="project-title"
    href="https://trungk18.github.io/jquery-loading/"
    target="_blank"
    >jquery-loading</a
  >
  <span class="project-date">2016</span>
</h3>

A lightweight library to show a "loading" indicator while element is retrieving
from server.

My team at
<a href="https://www.thechosenlab.com/" target="_blank">Chosen Lab</a> renovated
this website using
<a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby" target="_blank">Gatsby</a>, a
blazing fast modern site generator for React. This is the first time we built a
headless CMS. We chose
<a href="https://www.datocms.com/" target="_blank">DatoCMS</a> for that purpose.

<h3 class="project-content">
  <a class="project-title" href="https://www.zyllem.com/" target="_blank"
    >Zyllem Internal Web App</a
  >
  <span class="project-date">2016 - Now</span>
</h3>

<p>
  I have been the only front end engineer since I joined Zyllem (as of July
  2019, the team has a new front end mate joined). I built all the SPA(s)
  (Single Page App) inside Zyllem platform with TypeScript and Angular. Until
  now, the number of SPA(s) in Zyllem platform has been growing so quickly
  comparing to the starting point three years ago.
</p>

<p>
  We have been building SPA and API to replace the traditional server-side MVC
  Razor view. Our SPA(s) are ranging from simple CRUD app with only form and
  list view, to some super complex app that using state management (ngrx/ ngxs)
  to handle a large number of data on client-side.
</p>

<p>
  We have few apps which display a parallel view on the UI, one side is the data
  representation in text view and the other side displaying the same data on the
  interactive map view. Users can interact with one side and the application
  will reflect the changes on the other side and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
  Many apps also support real-time updates on UI, so the single source of data
  concept must be a part of the whole application architecture. Otherwise, it
  will become very error prone If you don't know where the data come from. Or If
  you update the local component data but it didn't reflect on the shared
  service data.
</p>
<p>
  The final target is to do a switch to make our application 100% client-side or
  at least 80% client-side. For now, only some configuration parts on the system
  still rely on the MVC Razor.

A big scale project. Still, I did all the front end matters.

I took care of all the front end matters, includes converting PSD to HTML
responsive, using SASS.

<h3 class="project-content">

    >HEINZ</a

<p>
  A freelance web project to complete in a short time frame, basically
  translated PSD to responsive HTML
</p>
